PuppetDB
========

PuppetDB collects data generated by Puppet. It allows to have a global overview of every node of the Spinal Stack deployment and their resource in a centralized place.

Requirements
------------

In Spinal Stack, PuppetDB is configured the following way :

  * The PuppetDB daemon runs on the install-server node with SSL disabled. Hence, it runs on 127.0.0.1:8080
  * Nodes still reach PuppetDB using SSL. SSL is terminated at the webserver level via a vhost listening on port 8081 that also serves as a proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080

Configuration of PuppetDB happens before step 1 since it needs to be ready for the really first run. Hence the SSL certificate needs to be present a deployment time.

How to push the PuppetDB certificate during the deployment:

  * On baremetal or virtualized deployment: push the file in your environment in etc/ssl/certs/puppetdb.pem and it will automatically copied on the install-server.
    Spinal Stack will take care of the permissions during the bootstrap.
  * On Inception deployment, running Heat, you can provide puppetdb_pem parameter in your environment, containing the RAW data of your certificate.
    During the stack creation with Heat, cloud-init will take care to create the file on the install-server instance.

.. warning::
    To start correctly, the PuppetDB certificate has to be in place at /etc/ssl/certs/puppetdb.pem otherwise PuppetDB won't start
    and the whole deployment will fail. If the file does not exist during the deployment, the configure.sh script will fail to avoid
    useless debug during the deployment.
